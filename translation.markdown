I translate from German to English. My work includes exhibitions, biographies, travel writing and websites.

  I translated the [autobiography of Muho](https://www.amazon.de/Zazen-oder-Weg-zum-Gl%C3%BCck/dp/3499622033), former abbot of the Zen monastery Antaiji.
It's available as an ebook here: [https://books2read.com/ZazenAndThePathToHappiness](https://books2read.com/ZazenAndThePathToHappiness)
