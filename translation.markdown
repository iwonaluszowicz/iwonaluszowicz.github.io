I translate from German to English. My work includes exhibitions, biographies, travel writing, websites and book synopses. 
 
Some of my favourite past and present projects:

 - _Zen and the Path to Happiness_  
  I’m currently (nearly finished!) translating the [autobiography of Muho](https://www.amazon.de/Zazen-oder-Weg-zum-Gl%C3%BCck/dp/3499622033), former abbot of the Zen monastery Antaiji.  

 - [_Foreign Affairs Translates_: 2018-19 theatre translator mentorship](https://www.foreignaffairs.org.uk/theatre-translator-mentorship/)  
  I translated the play _Mensch Meier_ by [Franz Xaver Kroetz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Xaver_Kroetz).

  - [_Being Conchita: We are Unstoppable_](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Being-Conchita-Unstoppable-7-May-2015-Hardcover/dp/B011T77IDO)
