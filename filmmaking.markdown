My filmmaking journey started during lockdown in 2021. I took an online course with the adult education college City Lit and made a little film about a stuffed penguin and its human housemate (see below).

In 2022, I completed a certificate in filmmaking at the NFTS and a practical filmmaking traineeship with Four Corners Studio in East London. (Thank you to the BFI and Tower Hamlets Council for funding.)

In 2023, I produced and directed my first ‘proper’ short film, Sugar Push. We’re currently still in post-production, but you can check out the film’s [instagram @sugarpushshortfilm](https://www.instagram.com/sugarpushshortfilm/)

I’ve linked two of my videos below. They’re very much student projects, but they make me laugh and might make some of you laugh too…


## Penguin Pandemonium

This was the first film I made. Writing and shooting it during lockdown, I knew I needed something that could be shot entirely within my house, with a maximum of one (human) actor. 

I think both the penguin and my housemate Kevin did a fab job.

Two things I learnt by making this film: 1) in-built camera mics don’t make for nice sound quality; and 2) getting wide-shot coverage of the entire scene, in addition to any close-ups, will make the edit a whole lot easier.


## Five Things

I shot this for a homework task on my NFTS filmmaking certificate. We were doing a module on editing, and our brief was to create a story by juxtaposing no more than five images or shots. 

When I showed this to my sister, she said it was ‘horrible’. I don’t entirely disagree.
