My filmmaking journey started during lockdown in 2021. I took an online course with the adult education college City Lit and made a little film about a stuffed penguin and its human housemate (see below).

After that, I completed a certificate in filmmaking at the NFTS and a practical filmmaking traineeship with Four Corners Studio in East London. Thank you to the BFI and Tower Hamlets Council for the funding that made this possible!

In 2023, I produced and directed my first ‘proper’ short film, Sugar Push, which follows a young woman attending a swing dance social. We’re currently still in post-production, but you can check out the film’s instagram for some behind the scenes snaps @sugarpushshortfilm 

I’ve linked two of my videos below. They’re very much student projects, but they make me laugh and might make some of you laugh too…
