Hi! I’m Iwona.

I’m half-German, half-Polish, and grew up in Reading, England. 
After studying psychology and philosophy, I started doing freelance translation alongside an unintentionally diverse range of other jobs, including working for a library, an awful café and the Quakers.

I currently work as a translator/proofreader and filmmaking trainee.
